This is my version of the "**Data Pagination and Filtering**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree**.

In this project, I had to use a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

I received file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. I then had to use my JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page, and then you add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

The application works with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. This means my solution is flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.

The Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.

I received an "Exceeds Expectation" grade upon submitting the project.
